Whenever editing Ruby (`.rb`) or ERB (`.erb`) files, run RuboCop to check for linting violations and suggest fixes. Use the project's `bin/rubocop` command if present. Ensure that code style is consistent with existing RuboCop configuration.

- Fix any RuboCop violations before finalizing code changes
- Run `bin/rubocop` to check files when editing Ruby or ERB files
- Use `bin/rubocop -a` to automatically autocorrect many common problems
- Address RuboCop errors before committing or merging code

Examples:
- On saving `app/models/user.rb`, run RuboCop checks
- On editing `app/views/posts/index.erb`, analyze ERB code with RuboCop
